# Getting Started with Angular Example App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3 and designed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
It demonstrates how to setup railz-visualizations with Angular via the `@railzai/railz-visualizations-angular` package

## Usage

- If your backend authentication server is setup, you can run the following commands to get your React project up and running.
- You will need to enter the backend authentication API url in the Auth Url input so you can request your access token.
- Once you have your token you can enter in your business and other filter info to load your visualizations.

```bash
