# Getting Started with React Example App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and designed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
It demonstrates how to setup railz visualizations with React via the `@railzai/railz-visualizations-react` package

## Usage
- If your backend authentication server is setup, you can run the following commands to get your React project up and running.
- You will need to enter the backend authentication API url in the Auth Url input so you can request your access token.
- Once you have your token you can enter in your business and other filter info to load your visualizations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/railz-ai/railz-visualizations

cd railz-visualizations/examples/react-example

yarn install

yarn start
```

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/railz-ai/railz-visualizations

cd railz-visualizations

yarn react
```
