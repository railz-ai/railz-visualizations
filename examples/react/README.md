# Getting Started with React Example App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and designed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
It demonstrates how to setup railz visualizations with React via the `@railzai/railz-visualizations-react` package

## Usage

- Once you have your token you can enter in your business and other filter info to load your visualizations.
