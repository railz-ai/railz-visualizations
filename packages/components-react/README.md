## Local Development

### Link Your Packages

To build and test your components locally, you will need to link the packages together. This is a replacement for publishing packages to npm that allows you to develop and test locally.

To do this, weâ€™ll use the npm link command, follow the steps below to setup local environment.

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies using yarn install or npm install
3. Build the **packages/components** library and create a symlink to the library.

```bash
npm run build
npm link
```

With the symlink created, the React component library will need to consume the stencil component library.
Go to `packages/components-react` folder and run the below:

```bash
npm link @railzai/railz-visualizations
```

And with that, the react component library is linked to the stencil component library are linked together.

In your react component library, you need to create its own symlink.

```bash
npm run build
npm link
```

#### Usage

In your own React Application, you can run the below to link both libraries

```bash
npm link @railzai/railz-visualizations-react
```

To make use of the React component library in your React application, import the components from the React component library in the file where you want to use them.

```typescript jsx
import { RailzVisualizations } from '@railzai/railz-visualizations-react';
```
