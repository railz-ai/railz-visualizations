# Components Angular

This is an angular wrapper for `@railzai/railz-visualization`, it was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build components-angular`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/components-angular` and run `npm publish`.

## Local Development

To build and test your components locally, you will need to link the packages together. This is a replacement for publishing packages to npm that allows you to develop and test locally.

To do this, weâ€™ll use the npm link command, follow the steps below to setup local environment.

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies using yarn install or npm install
3. Build the **packages/components** library and create a symlink to the library.

```bash
npm run build
npm link
```

### Link Your Packages

With the symlink created, the Angular component library will need to consume the stencil component library.
Go to `packages/components-angular` folder and run the below:

```bash
npm link @railzai/railz-visualizations
```

And with that, the angular component library is linked to the stencil component library are linked together.

In your angular component library, you need to create its own symlink.

```bash
npm run build
npm link
```

#### Usage

In your own Angular Application, you can run the below to link both libraries

```bash
npm link @railzai/railz-visualizations-angular
```

To make use of the Angular component library in your Angular application, set up your module file to import the visualizations module.

```typescript
import { RailzVisualizationsModule } from '@railzai/railz-visualizations-angular/dist';
```
